# Star Solutions

Enterprise-grade project & task management dashboard. Next.js 14 + Supabase + Tailwind + i18n (EN/AR with RTL) + Realtime.

## Quick start

1. `npm install`
2. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
3. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase URL and anon key
4. In Supabase SQL editor, run the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` to create tables, RLS policies, and triggers
5. `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000
6. Sign up — the first user is automatically made admin (via trigger); subsequent users default to `team_member` (promote from the Team page)
7. **(Optional) Load B2C demo data** — after signing up, paste `supabase/seed.sql` into the SQL editor and run it. You'll get 6 realistic projects (MVP e-commerce, mobile app, payments, support portal, marketing, SEO), ~40 tasks across all statuses, sample comments, and notifications. Safe to re-run — it wipes and reseeds the `[SEED]` rows.
